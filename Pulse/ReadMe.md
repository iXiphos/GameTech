In this game, you have to survive waves of enemies. However you can not see these enemies unless you shoot and fire a pulse wave.
The Pulse wave functions like a radar and will reveal all enemies that it touches but only for a short time.
Do your best to survive the waves of enemies.

This was done using a rendering shader and multiple cameras to simulate the effect.
