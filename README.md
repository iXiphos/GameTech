# GameTech
Games that were created during game tech, I spent 2 weeks on each of them

Each game had to be a different type of game and I spent extra time learning a new thing with each one

Maze Game: A* Pathfinding

Vertical Shooter: Polish and Effects

Platformer: Mechanic Creation with a little bit of graphics

Grid Game: Managing Multiple players and turns

Final project: Graphics
