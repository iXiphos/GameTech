# GameTech
Games that were created during game tech, I spent 2 weeks on each of them. They were all made with Unity 2018.3.3f1.
They are missing an exit game function, so it is recommended you play each of them in windowed mode.

Each game had to be a different type of game and I spent extra time learning a new thing with each one. Check each game for a readme with a larger breakdown

Maze Game: A* Pathfinding

Vertical Shooter: Polish and Effects

Platformer: Mechanic Creation with a little bit of graphics

Grid Game: Managing Multiple players and turns

Final project: Graphics and top down shooting
