This game is a puzzle platformer with 5 levels. You goal is to reach the end and be as close to par as possible.
You can reset yourself back to the start, however you create a ghost that mimics all of your previous movements.
When your ghost reaches the end of its life cycle, it will stop and you can jump on it or have it press buttons for you.

This is done by recording the players location and reducing the size of the array of these locations. Then spawning an temporary object to follow this path.
